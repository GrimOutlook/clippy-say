## Caveats

Currently you have to format the input string yourself. The speech bubbles
width is tied to the length of the longest string in your input. The height
of the speech bubble is tied to the number of newlines in your input. All input
is left justified. Any other justification currently needs to be added manually
to the input before submission to Clippy.

## Future Features

- Justification
    - Left
    - Center
    - Right
- Max width tied to terminal frame width
- Automatic formatting of text from one to multiple lines.
